Run nesmenu.py, the first time it will create the folder ~/.nesmenu, and copy the default configfiles there.
Ajust them to your needs, and start nesmenu again.

TODO:
- Fix a segmentation fault that sometimes occurs immediately after the emulator exits. [Seems to be ok now, needs some testing]
- Set itemsPerPage option automatically based on resolution and textsize               [DONE!]
- Fix db.rescan so that favourites are not lost during rescan
- Maybe, if I feel up for it, add support for "analog" joysticks
